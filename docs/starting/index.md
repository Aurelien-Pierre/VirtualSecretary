# Getting started

This section will show you how to build an application by implementing the Virtual Secretary features. This will involve writing Python scripts, for which the Virtual Secretary package provides helpers to achieve fairly common tasks with a minimum amount of (legible) code.

At the end of this tutorial, you should be able to:

1. run email filters on an IMAP server,
2. connect your CardDAV address book to your email filters,
3. write your own email filters and email auto-responders,
4. crawl websites and local files to assemble a corpus of HTML and PDF documents,
5. train a natural language processing artificial intelligence on the corpus, to be reused later,
6. use the trained AI to create an email classifier,
7. use the trained AIÂ to create a search engine of web pages and PDF documents,
8. create a server-side Rest API for the search engine,
9. connect an email auto-responder or a chat bot to the search engine results, to automatically answer customer inquiries.

The purpose of the tutorial as to show you how quickly you can bootstrap an application performing typical tasks. As such, it focuses on basic, typical tasks. You can extend everything in the way you see fit by reusing the huge ecosystem of Python packages.
